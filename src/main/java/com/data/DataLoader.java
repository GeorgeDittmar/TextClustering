 * The DataLoader object's job is to take a directory and read in documents from sub folders, where the subfolders are
 * used to denote document class. Example if you point the DataLoader to a folder named documents and there are 2 subfolders in it
 * called fiction and non-fiction; these two sub folders will denote the number of clusters / classes we will try to learn.
